# PMSF py-osc2 Framework

PMSF py-osc2 is a Python framework for working with ASAM OpenSCENARIO 2 scenario files.

Note that this package is currently provided as a community service.
It is based on the current public review draft of the language, which is non-final, and might include updates based on current developments.
It is offered without any support and should be considered draft alpha quality.
